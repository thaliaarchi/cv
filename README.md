# Thalia Archibald's CV

This is my curriculum vitæ, viewable at <https://cv.thalia.dev/>.

I am applying to PhD programs in programming languages and systems software.

Its design is intended to resemble a paper document, precise, with understated
simplicity, and is minimal in implementation. No JavaScript, no bloat. No code
generation; just HTML with embedded CSS. It is inconspicuously responsive and
adapts for printing, but it doesn't look like a résumé for web development. It
uses my favorite humanist typeface, Fira Sans, which has subtle flourishes.

Its layout is inspired by [Greg Rosenblatt's CV](https://www.gregrosenblatt.com/)
[[source](https://github.com/gregr/gregr.github.io)], though they share no code.

If you want to use design ideas or code from it, it is made available under the
